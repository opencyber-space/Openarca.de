# 🚀 Bidding, Voting & Delegation System

**A modular backend for orchestrating structured bidding, social voting, and task delegation workflows.**
DSL-configurable, event-driven, and designed for distributed multi-agent systems.

### Project Status 🚧

* **Alpha**: This project is in active development and subject to rapid change. ⚠️
* **Testing Phase**: Features are experimental; expect bugs, incomplete functionality, and breaking changes. 🧪
* **Not Production-Ready**: We **do not recommend using this in production** (or relying on it) right now. ⛔
* **Compatibility**: APIs, schemas, and configuration may change without notice. 🔄
* **Feedback Welcome**: Early feedback helps us stabilize future releases. 💬

## 🌟 Highlights

### 🧱 Modular Task Execution Lifecycle

* 📨 Create and evaluate bidding tasks using DSLs
* 🗳️ Conduct flexible, rule-driven voting workflows with pre-qualification
* 🔁 Delegate sub-tasks to agents via voting, bidding, or DSL strategies
* 📑 Store results, evaluation outputs, and audit logs

### 🧠 Intelligent Workflow Orchestration

* 🧩 Define custom workflows via domain-specific languages (DSLs)
* 🕹️ Evaluate bids and votes with configurable scoring logic and tie-breakers
* 👥 Human-in-the-loop hooks for inspection or overrides
* 📢 Result broadcasting over NATS or webhooks

### 🔍 Real-Time Status and Auditing

* 📊 WebSocket live updates for voting tasks and delegation states
* 🧾 Persisted result bundles for audit and verification
* 🔍 Query APIs for metadata, statuses, and voting summaries

## 💡 Why Use This?

| Problem                                              | Our Solution                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔹 Inflexible bidding or voting logic                | DSL-driven workflows for each phase                        |
| 🔹 Manual or error-prone evaluation processes        | Automated evaluation jobs with traceable DSL outputs       |
| 🔹 Poor visibility into task states                  | Live status updates via WebSockets + NATS                  |
| 🔹 Difficult multi-agent coordination and delegation | Standardized pipeline for delegation and response tracking |
