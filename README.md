# 🎮 OpenArcade: Social Decision Making for AI Societies

[![Part of Ecosystem: AGI Grid](https://img.shields.io/badge/⚡️Part%20of%20Ecosystem-AGI%20Grid-0A84FF?style=for-the-badge)](https://www.AGIGr.id)

**OpenArcade** is a framework for **computational social choice in Multi-Agent Systems (MAS)** and the **Internet of Agents (IoA)**.  
It provides the mechanisms for shaping the composition and behavior of agent populations over time, enabling **collective decision-making, coordination, and governance** in large-scale, distributed agent societies.

---

## 🌍 Vision

In human societies, collective decision-making is central to governance, resource allocation, and conflict resolution.  
OpenArcade brings this principle into **machine-executable, scalable, and verifiable systems**, ensuring that autonomous agents can cooperate, deliberate, and decide **without central control**.

OpenArcade becomes the **political layer of MAS and IoA**, defining how:

- 🗳️ Group decisions on tasks, resources are made  
- 🔄 Norms evolve  
- 📜 Governance policies are formed  
- ⚖️ Conflicts are resolved  
- 🎯 Collective objectives emerge from diverse agent preferences  

OpenArcade provides formal methods for moving from many inputs to one outcome. Whether the input is preferences, judgments, or proposals, each method defines how agents interact and how the final decision is produced.

---

## 🧭 Core Principles

- **📥 Structured Input Gathering**  
  Ensure all relevant perspectives are captured, validated, and made interpretable across heterogeneous agents.

- **⚖️ Equitable Decision Formation**  
  Balance fairness, efficiency, and robustness while resisting manipulation.

- **✅ Accountable Execution**  
  Translate collective outcomes into coordinated action, enforce compliance, and monitor real-world impact.

- **🔧 Adaptive Governance**  
  Continuously evolve rules, norms, and protocols alongside the agent population and environment.

---

## 🏗️ Framework Overview

OpenArcade implements **decision-making strategies** as interchangeable building blocks in MAS decision architectures.  


- A system could use:   **💬 Discussion → 🧠 Argumentation ↔  🗳️ Voting ↔ 🤝 Consensus Building** as sequential strategies depending on context and requirements.


These strategies span the full lifecycle of collective choice:

### 1️⃣ Pre-Decision Strategies - Structuring Inputs  

Gathering and structuring information, facilitating dialogue, and aligning on problem definitions

- 💬 Deliberation protocols  
- 🧠 Argumentation frameworks  
- 📊 Judgment aggregation  
- 🗨️ Collaborative Discussion  
- 🤝 Negotiation 

###  2️⃣  Decision Strategies - Collective Choice Formation  

Aggregating inputs, applying choice mechanisms, and producing final outcomes 

- 📊 Preference aggregation  
- 🗳️ Voting  
- 🔗 Matching & Assignment  
- ⚖️ Fair division  
- 👥 Coalition formation  
- ⚖️ Weighted Decision-Making  
- 📐 Multi-Criteria Decision-Making (MCDM)  
- 🤝 Consensus Building  


### 3️⃣ Post-Decision Strategies - Execution & Adaptation  

Enforcing agreements, adapting norms, and refining governance models based on outcomes

- 📜 Norm & Policy evolution  
- 🌐 Distributed Agreement  

---

## Why OpenArcade?

Without formalized decision frameworks, MAS and IoA risk:  

- **Gridlock** – agents unable to agree on a course of action  
- **Fragmentation** – splintering into incompatible sub-networks  
- **Domination** – manipulation by powerful or strategic actors  

OpenArcade prevents these outcomes by embedding **computable, transparent, and fair governance protocols** into the fabric of agent societies.

---

## 🤖 From Autonomy to Collective Intelligence

MAS and IoA represent a shift from **isolated intelligence to networked intelligence**.  
OpenArcade operationalizes this by embedding **computational social choice** into the infrastructure of agent societies - enabling billions of agents to cooperate, deliberate, and evolve shared governance at planetary scale.

---

**A modular backend for orchestrating structured bidding, social voting, and task delegation workflows.**
DSL-configurable, event-driven, and designed for distributed multi-agent systems.
